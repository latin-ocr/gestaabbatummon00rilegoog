X INTRODUCTION.

closing years of Abbot Thomas de la Mare, who died
A.D. 1396. The earlier portion of the history, as might
be expected, is a compilation embodying the works of
antecedent writers on the subject; while the account
of the later Abbots‚ from the ¹ commencing portion of
the l4th century, is an original compilation from the
'1:119 Gesta 2 pen of Walsingham himself. In the manuscript itself
amaad, the work runs on without any break, except at the

for con-

venienee‚ 3 beginning of the life of each new Abbot; but for

ξ’ζὲῐῑῖξζθε convenience of arrangement, and the better recognition

of the distinct authorship of each part, it has been
divided into three Sections in these volumeS‚ which
admit of being thus characterized.—
The Finit The First Section‚——originally proceeding, to a great
mon, extent, from the pen of Matthew Paris, but occasionally

ξζωᾶὶέῗ altered towards the end, either by Walsingham or a

θ foundation of the Monastery to the ⁴ twentieth year
of John de Hertford, twenty-third Abbot, AD. 1255.

in its later ysam, from materials probably no longer in
existence. It ends with the death of John de θ Maryns‚
twenty-einh Abbo‘t, in March 1308.
