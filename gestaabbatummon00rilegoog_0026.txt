alterations

in the text the Gesta begins materially to alter the text of the Vitoe

consideration the time at which Adam the Cellarer 3lived‚
strongly imply that the account of the earlier Abbots
in the Vitoe Abbatum was derived from an ancient Roll

this Adam, or had been in his possession before it
