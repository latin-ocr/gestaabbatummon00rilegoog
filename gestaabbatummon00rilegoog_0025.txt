monastic habit there. In page 242 he again speaks 01·
himself, ΒΥ name, as the writer, and as having heard
from the lips of Robert of London his (at least, very
doubtful) account of the contemplated apostasy 01· King
John ; a story which, however, does not appear in the
Vitoe Abbatwm of MS. Nero D. i., but was interpolated,
probably ΒΥ Walsingham or his scribes, from the
Historia Major (s. a. 1213), or some other source, now
unknown. In folio 68 b., col. 2, of the Additcmmnta in
MS. Nero D. i. (page 324 of the present Volume) occur
the words z—“A tempore dico suoe creationis usque in
“ annum 821.oe praelatioms vicesimum; que, scibicet, hoec
‘⁶ payina a Fratre M atthoeo scripta est Parisiemi, qui de
“ saturis «non proesumit diffinire .· '’—in which he again,
and finally, acknowledges himself to be the writer of
the Vitae Abbaw‘m. After this passage in MS. Nero D. i.,
the ent-ries are disconnected and fragmentary, and, as
already ¹ noticed‚ 01· a varied and miscellaneous nature.
Some few passages, however, in Section I. of the Gesta
Abbatwm are evidently not the composition of Matthew

pp. 97—1063 additions either ΒΥ Walsingham or ΒΥ
his anonymous predecessor, the compilet of the Second
Section 01· the Gesta. So again, in page 308, a pmsage
has been interpolated in allusion to Abbot Thomas de
la Mare (who died in 1396), ΒΥ Walsingham‚ no doubt.
Some passages have also been added, probably by the
same hand, to the text 01· the Vitoe Abbatwm from the
Historia Majo‘t· of the same writer3 as in the case of
the story of Robert of London‚ above noticed, pp. 236-
