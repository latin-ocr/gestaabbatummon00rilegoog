In reference to the authorship of the Vitoe Abba-

of the Gesta Abbatum has been thus derived, Mat-
thew Paris is found mentioning himself, by 'nt-rme, as

&tantai- the writer, in speaking of the sources of information

the Abbey of St. Alban’s; a story which 116 may pro-
bably have heard during his visit to the Abbey of
Holm, in N orway, in 1248, mentioned in the Historia
